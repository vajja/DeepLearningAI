      "2. **Perform Data Analysis**: With `pandas` and `numpy`, analyze the retrieved data to determine trends, calculate percentage changes, and identify any patterns.\n",
      "3. **Scrape Relevant News and Events**: Use `beautifulsoup4` or `scrapy` to collect news articles or significant events that occurred during the month that might have impacted stock performance.\n",
      "4. **Visualize Data**: Use `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to create charts that illustrate the stock performance trend.\n",
      "5. **Compile Information**: Combine all the collected data and analyses into a draft for the blog post.\n",
